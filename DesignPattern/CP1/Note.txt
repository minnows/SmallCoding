1. Add new feature fly
   Add to base class will cause Rubber Duck fly
   Rewrite fly in child class  -----> code duplication think about adding a wooden duck
   How about an interface ?  Multiple inheritance ? ---->  Code duplication.

















 
2. Way to fix
   Identify the aspect of your applications that vary and separate tem from what stays the same  
   Program to an interface not an implementation
   Favor composition over inheritance
